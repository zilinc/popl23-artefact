# Verification

The driver is formally verified in `DriverProof.thy`

It can take some time to parse the generated theory files
(in particular, CorresSetup can take more than one hour).

# Compilation

To see how the files in the directory `generated`, see the Makefile.


# List of files
- `generated/`: files generated by the compiler (in particular, shallow 
embedding and compilation to C)
- `driver.cogent`: cogent implementation of the driver
- `unverified.c`: unverified part of the driver
- `DriverSpec.thy`: abstract driver and specification 
- `DriverProof.thy`: formal proof that the shallow embedding of the cogent driver
    satisfies the abstract specification
- `DriverGetSet.thy`: Additionnal correctness proof about getter and setters
